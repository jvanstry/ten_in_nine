Ten apps in 9 weeks
====================

My ongoing attempt to build 10 apps in 9(ish) weeks. I'm doing this mostly to further my knowledge of my preferred language Javascript/get some experience with node. But it's also helping me to brush up on my native language (Ruby) as well as get some exposure to new ones(iOS and Erlang apps are on the horizon). 

My original idea was to have 9 weekly apps built along with one larger app spanning the entire project. It has quickly turned into me working on several projects at once. This repository is the first app I built and will serve as a bucket of sorts for all the other apps and hopefully my portofolio when job hunting time comes along. 

TODO on this app
================
Make responsive / Generally improve aesthetics
